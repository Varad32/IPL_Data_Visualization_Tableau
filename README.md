# IPL_Data_Visualization_Tableau

IPL data from 2008 to 2017 has been visualized using visualization tool Tableau Desktop. Some the questions I have answered using this data is like Orange and Purple Cap Holder for each year, Highest number of 4s and 6s hit by player each year, Highest batting average, highest bowling average, Toss outcome Vs Match outcome, Team performance (Away Vs Home)
